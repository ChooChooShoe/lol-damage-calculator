DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' does not remove any active [[crowd control]] (e.g [[nearsight]]), however, '''Sion''' remains fully immune to crowd control through the whole effect including the final ''leap''. For example, striking ''Sion'' with {{ai|Blinding Dart|Teemo}} right before the effect ends will not cause him to be blinded when the ''charge'' or ''leap'' finishes.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding ** After starting the ''charge'' '''Sion's''' movement speed cannot be artificially changed.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * After reaching maximum damage and stun duration (at 3 seconds) '''Sion''' will transition from using his ''haste'' animation to his unique ''charging'' one.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding ** Reaching the threshold on '''Mecha Zero Sion''' changes his particle effects instead, most notably the 'Boosters' behind the train.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * {{Pending for test}} The maximum turning angle (per distance traveled) of the ''charge'' is constant. The turning radius is a constant value, estimated at roughly 2500 units.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding ** This is not true when starting at insanely high values of movement speed; '''Sion''' will be facing the direction of the cast in his ''idle'' animation and turn at a much lower rate based on the speed he started with until his speed returns to the usual 950 MS limit.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding ** That the turning angle is not based on time can easily be seen in practice when a '''Sion''' ''charges'' in-place due to bugs.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * '''Sion''' does not always crash with terrain immediately upon touching it, enabling the player to turn beyond his maximum turning angle.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding ** Casting the ability at point blank of a terrain will most often automatically change the ''charge's'' direction.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding ** This is not usually possible with player-generated terrain.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding ** Uniquely, colliding with '''allied''' {{ii|Zz'Rot Portal|Zz'Rot Portals}} during the ''charge'' does not cause '''Sion''' to stop but instead redirect him. Completely surrounding Sion with '''allied''' {{ii|Zz'Rot Portal|Zz'Rot Portals}} will cause ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' to ''charge'' in place once a Portal is touched, until it ends or a hole in the formation is opened.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' cannot ''charge'' through but can ''leap'' over player-created terrain (i.e {{ai|Crystallize|Anivia}}, {{ii|Zz'Rot Portal}}).
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding ** The charge will not collide with an ''allied'' {{ai|Emperor's Divide|Azir}}.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * {{Pending for test}} The distance between '''Sion's''' center and the center of the ground ''slam'' scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of ''charge'' time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * {{Pending for test}} The ''leap'' appears to always have the same speed regardless of '''Sion's''', at roughly 750.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * Hovering the cursor on the HUD (e.g minimap / champion portraits) does not affect the cast and steering of ''Unstoppable Onslaught''.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * Even though the ability doesn't have a distance limit, casting the ability outside its ''cast range'' (7500 units), will have '''Sion''' attempt to walk in range before ''charging''.

DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * {{Pending for test}} The maximum turning angle (per distance traveled) of the ''charge'' is constant. The turning radius is a constant value, estimated at roughly 2500 units.
DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding ** This is not true when starting at insanely high values of movement speed; '''Sion''' will be facing the direction of the cast in his ''idle'' animation and turn at a much lower rate based on the speed he started with until his speed returns to the usual 950 MS limit.

DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding ** Uniquely, colliding with '''allied''' {{ii|Zz'Rot Portal|Zz'Rot Portals}} during the ''charge'' does not cause '''Sion''' to stop but instead redirect him.

DEBUG: backtracing key to notes adding * {{Pending for test}} The distance between '''Sion's''' center and the center of the ground ''slam'' scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of ''charge'' time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug.
