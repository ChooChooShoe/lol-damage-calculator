      "notes": "'''Zealous'''\n* The stacking attack speed can be tracked in the HUD via a buff called [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal''', while the maximum stacks bonus grants the buff [[File:Divine Ascent.png|20px|link=]] '''Exalted'''.\n* Subsequent applications will also refresh the duration of all stacks, but all of them are lost when expired.\n* If '''Kayle''' is in her attack animation after the stacks expire, she gains another {{fd|0.5}} seconds to refresh/stack [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal'''.\n* Each stack increase attack speed based on the amount of ability power '''Kayle''' has at the time the stack is acquired and will not update if it is changed.\n** For example, if a stack acquired while she has no ability power, it will the increase attack speed by {{sti|attack speed|{{as|6%|attack speed}}}}. If {{sti|ability power|{{as|200|ability power}}}} acquired afterwards, the next stack will grant {{sti|attack speed|{{as|8%|attack speed}}}}. The two increased attack speed by {{sti|attack speed|{{as|14%|attack speed}}}} (6 + 8) and not {{sti|attack speed|{{as|16%|attack speed}}}} (8 + 8).\n'''Arisen'''\n* Basic attacks within {{sti|range|175}} will still use '''Kayle's''' melee basic attack animations and do not utilize {{tip|projectile|projectiles}}.\n** They are still classified as {{tip|ranged}} attacks.\n** Due to this fact, projectile blocking effects cannot intercept basic attacks while '''Kayle's''' target is within her \"melee\" range.\n'''Aflame'''\n* Basic attacks against [[structures]] do not trigger fire waves.\n* While at 4 stacks of [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal''', the next {{tip|on-attack}} reaching the fifth stack will be empowered by {{sbc|Aflame}}, releasing the first fire wave.\n'''Transcendent'''\n* [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal''' and [[File:Divine Ascent.png|20px|link=]] '''Exalted''' buffs swapped to a new buff that grants the benefit of both and it is not visible on Kayle's HUD.\n* This buff also updates its {{as|attack speed}} value whenever a {{tt|stat update|A stat update happens once every 0.25 seconds.}} happens and {{as|ability power}} is changed, however, it does not track {{as|ability power}} from other buffs, unless they have been specifically special cased. The following buffs are not special cased yet and will not grant bonus {{as|attack speed}}:\n** [[Rune]]s (including [[File:Rune shard Adaptive Force.png|20px|link=Runes Reforged#Shards]] [[Runes Reforged#Shards|Adaptive Force rune shards]] )\n** {{bi|Infernal Might}}\n** {{cai|W|Yuumi}}\n'''Fire Waves Details'''\n* [[File:Celestine Wish Kayle Fire Wave.png|thumb|Hitboxes shows by a graph side by side.]] A wave consists of three projectiles for the hitbox and a fourth for visuals.\n* The hitbox projectiles spawn 75 units behind '''Kayle''', travel through her, and are destroyed once they've traveled 850 units. Their technical details are:\n** {{sbc|Range:}} {{tip|cr|850}} (755 effective)\n** {{sbc|Width:}} {{tip|er|200}}\n** {{sbc|Projectile Speed:}} 2800\n** {{sbc|Angle:}} 18{{degree}} (left and right at 9{{degree}} to their side, respectively)\n* {{tip|Projectile}} blocking effects can block each projectile individually.\n** It is possible to block the visuals, but still get hit by an unblocked \"invisible\" hitbox projectile.\n* Hitting an enemy with multiple projectiles of the same wave will not increase the damage dealt.\n* The fire wave shares {{tip|cast instance}} with the triggering basic attack.\n** The amount of {{ri|Conqueror}} stacks gained will be {{rd|2|1}} if the basic attack deals damage first or 2 if the wave does so.\n* Keep in mind that it's still two damage instances. If one triggers {{ri|Bone Plating}}, the other's damage will be blocked.\n* Fire waves roll {{tip|critical strike|critical strike chance}} on each target hit individually.\n* The distance of the fire waves scales with '''bonus''' attack range.\n* A known issue is that despite dealing {{tip|area damage|area spell damage}} the fire wave does not:\n** consume {{nie|Mana Charge}} from {{ii|Tear of the Goddess}} and its upgrades,\n** or trigger {{ri|Manaflow Band}}.\n'''Interactions & Other'''\n* Because '''Kayle''' is both a {{tip|melee}} and {{tip|ranged}} champion, she can purchase both ranged and melee exclusive items at anytime, but their effects will function depending on her current range type; the same principle also applies to [[runes]].\n** However, keep in mind that, prior to ascending to ''Arisen'', {{ai|Starfire Spellblade|Kayle}} also changes this behaviour based on its usage.\n* Waves are fired in the direction that '''Kayle''' is facing. Changing that during the attack windup via {{si|Flash}} will also change the direction of the wave.\n* Each ascension has an unique animation and a voice line. ''([[Kayle/LoL/Audio|See: Kayle's quotes]])''\n* The ascensions' animation will override the current one, but it does not cancel '''Kayle's''' current action, nor her previous orders.",

This also means that the lowest possible cast time is {{fd|0.033}} seconds, requiring at least {{sti|attack speed|{{as|5.8652|attack speed}}}} attack speed.\n** {{correction}} Important to note that in patch [[V9.17]], ''Radiant Blast's'' cast time was changed to be a flat {{fd|0.25}} seconds, rather than scaling with the attack windup time. In patch [[V10.4]], this was undocumentedly changed back. Whether the change to scale with windup time again was intentional or not is unknown.\n* The expansion consist of 5 hitboxes, forming a cross-like shape centered 100 units ahead from the impact in its direction. Their technical data can be seen below and visualized on the image to the right.

(Exception: {{ii|Muramana}}, see under '''Interactions & Other'''.)\n* Parry interactions:\n** {{tip|Blind}}: The main target will never receive damage, but the secondary targets will receive the active's spell damage.\n** {{tip|Block}}: Blocking will always negate all damage. Keep in mind that if a secondary target is outside of {{ais|Spirit's Refuge|Shen}} zone, they won't block damage.\n** {{tip|Dodge}}: Dodging will always negate all damage.\n* {{pending for test}}: All parry interactions are marked for retesting because of patch [[V11.1]] changes.\n'''Interactions & Other'''\n* While the active's effect is up, a circle is visible to '''Kayle''', indicating her {{sti|range}}, however, this circle only takes into account {{ais|Divine Ascent|Kayle}} effect on her range, not other sources such as {{ii|Rapid Firecannon}}.\n** The increased range (with the item's effect included) will be {{sti|range|675}} prior to ascending to {{sbc|Transcendent}}, after which it's {{sti|range|725}}.\n* To clarify the description, ''Starfire Spellblade'' can behave both as a {{tip|ranged}} and {{tip|melee}} attack based on how far the target is prior to '''Kayle''' ascending to {{ai|Divine Ascent|Kayle|Arisen}}, after which the attack will be always using ranged standards.\n** If the target is 200 units away or closer, the attack will be considered melee. This also uses her melee animations, not utilizing projectiles even after ascending.\n** If the target is over 200 units, the attack will be considered ranged.\n* To further expand on this: Using the ranged empowered attack will change '''Kayle's''' range type to ranged while the projectile is alive. This means that if the target could outrun the projectile, '''Kayle''' would be stuck on being ranged, although the bonuses from the active are not kept. While it's unlikely to be on this temporary ranged state for longer than half a seconds during a normal playthrough, it is possible to achieve few seconds when specific conditions are met.\n* Keep in mind that while on-hit effects will be applied to all targets in the explision, {{tip|on-attack}} effects are only applied once per basic attack, not per target hit.\n* Single-use on-hits, such as {{tip|Spellblade}}, will be applied to the main target.\n** If the main target died prior to the projectile reaching them, or if it was a [[Jungle plants|jungle plant]], the effects will be applied to the closest target from the explosion's center.\n* {{iis|Guinsoo's Rageblade}} {{nie|Phantom Hit}} can only be applied to the main target.\n* Despite being one cast instance, ''Starfire Spellblade'' triggers {{iis|Muramana}} {{nie|Shock}} twice on each target, dealing normal bonus damage after the basic attack and increased bonus damage after the spell, totalling at {{as|{{as|{{rd|{{fd|5}}%|{{fd|4.2}}%}} '''maximum''' mana}} {{as|(+ 6% AD)}} '''bonus''' physical damage|physical damage}}.",

This is only possible with very strict timing and perhaps high latency.\n** It's recommended to avoid this interaction, as this renders the usage of ''Divine Judgment'' useless in many cases.\n* Prior to becoming {{sbc|Transcended}}, casting ''Divine Judgment'' refreshes the duration of {{ai|Zealous|Kayle}} stacks.\n* If casted on herself, '''Kayle's''' basic {{stil|attack range|link=range}} is reduced to 400 during ''Divine Judgment's'' cast time to bring her within the effective range of the ability if attack commands are issued on an enemy.\n* The area around the target does not appear if the target is not {{tip|sight|visible}} to the enemies' point of view.\n* While the target is {{tip|invulnerable}}, a number indicator will appear beneath them whenever they would receive damage to show the amount that was entirely mitigated. This is calculated pre-mitigation, or before resistances and reductions are taken into account.\n'''Interactions & Other'''\n* {{iis|Rapid Firecannon}} {{nie|Energized}} behaves strangely with the set basic attack range, causing it to go from {{sti|range|400}} to {{sti|range|385}} over 4 {{tt|stat updates|A stat update occurs every 0.264 seconds.}}.
