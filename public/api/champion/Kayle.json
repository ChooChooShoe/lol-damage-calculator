For example, if a stack is acquired while '''Kayle''' has {{sti|{{as|100 ability power}}}}, it will grant {{sti|{{as|7% attack speed}}}}. If an additional {{sti|{{as|100 ability power}}}} is gained immediately afterwards (for a total of {{sti|{{as|200|ability power}}}}), the next stack will grant {{sti|attack speed|{{as|8%|attack speed}}}}. If all {{as|ability power}} is then immediately lost, the next stack will only grant {{sti|attack speed|{{as|6%|attack speed}}}}.\n* If '''Kayle''' is in her attack animation after the stacks expire, she gains another {{fd|0.5}} seconds to refresh/stack [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal'''.\n'''Arisen'''\n* Basic attacks within {{sti|range|175}} will still use '''Kayle's''' melee basic attack animations and do not utilize {{tip|projectile|projectiles}}.\n** They are still classified as {{tip|ranged}} attacks.\n** Due to this fact, projectile blocking effects cannot intercept basic attacks while '''Kayle's''' target is within her \"melee\" range.\n'''Aflame'''\n* Basic attacks against [[structures]] do not trigger fire waves.\n* While at 4 stacks of [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal''', the next {{tip|on-attack}} reaching the fifth stack will be empowered by {{sbc|Aflame}}, releasing the first fire wave.\n'''Transcendent'''\n* [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal''' and [[File:Divine Ascent.png|20px|link=]] '''Exalted''' buffs swapped to a new buff that grants the benefit of both and it is not visible on Kayle's HUD.\n** The {{as|attack speed}} no longer needs to be stacked up and will be always on maximum value.\n** This buff also updates its {{as|attack speed}} value whenever a stat update happens and {{as|ability power}} is changed. However, it does not track {{as|ability power}} from other buffs, unless they have been specifically special cased, unlike with [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal'''. The following buffs are not special cased yet:\n*** [[Rune]]s (excluding [[File:Rune shard Adaptive Force.png|20px|link=Runes Reforged#Shards]] [[Runes Reforged#Shards|Adaptive Force rune shards]] )\n*** {{bi|Infernal Might}}\n*** {{cai|W|Yuumi}}\n*** {{ii|Staff of Flowing Water}}\n'''Fire Waves Details'''\n* [[File:Celestine Wish Kayle Fire Wave.png|thumb|Hitboxes shows by a graph side by side.]] A wave consists of three projectiles for the hitbox and a fourth for visuals.\n* The hitbox projectiles spawn 75 units behind '''Kayle''', travel through her, and are destroyed once they've traveled 850 units. Their technical details are:\n** {{sbc|Range:}} {{tip|cr|850}} (755 effective)\n** {{sbc|Width:}} {{tip|er|200}}\n** {{sbc|Projectile Speed:}} 2800\n** {{sbc|Angle:}} 18{{degree}} (left and right at 9{{degree}} to their side, respectively)\n* {{tip|Projectile}} blocking effects can block each projectile individually.\n** It is possible to block the visuals, but still get hit by an unblocked \"invisible\" hitbox projectile.\n* Hitting an enemy with multiple projectiles of the same wave will not increase the damage dealt.\n* The fire wave shares {{tip|cast instance}} with the triggering basic attack.\n** The amount of {{ri|Conqueror}} stacks gained will be {{rd|2|1}} if the basic attack deals damage first or 2 if the wave does so.\n* Keep in mind that it's still two damage instances. If one triggers {{ri|Bone Plating}}, the other's damage will be blocked.\n* Fire waves roll {{tip|critical strike|critical strike chance}} on each target hit individually.\n* A known issue is that despite dealing {{tip|area damage|area spell damage}} the fire wave does not:\n** consume {{nie|Mana Charge}} from {{ii|Tear of the Goddess}} and its upgrades,\n** or trigger {{ri|Manaflow Band}}.\n'''Interactions & Other'''\n* Both the stacking and launching a fire wave is an {{tip|on-attack}} effect that is triggered whenever '''Kayle''' completes her {{tip|attack windup}}.\n* Because '''Kayle''' is both a {{tip|melee}} and {{tip|ranged}} champion, she can purchase both ranged and melee exclusive items at anytime, but their effects will function depending on her current range type; the same principle also applies to [[runes]].\n* Waves are fired in the direction that '''Kayle''' is facing. Changing that during the early animation via {{si|Flash}} will also change the direction of the wave.\n* Each ascension has an unique animation and a voice line. ''([[Kayle/LoL/Audio|See: Kayle's quotes]])''\n* The ascensions' animation will override the current one, but it does not cancel '''Kayle's''' current action, nor her previous orders.",

(Exception: {{ii|Muramana}}, see under '''Interactions'''.)\n* Parry interactions:\n** {{tip|Blind}}: The main target will never receive damage, but the secondary targets will receive the active's spell damage.\n** {{tip|Block}}: Blocking will always negate all damage. Keep in mind that if a secondary target is outside of {{ais|Spirit's Refuge|Shen}} zone, they won't block damage.\n** {{tip|Dodge}}: Dodging will always negate all damage.\n* {{pending for test}}: All parry interactions are marked for retesting because of patch [[V11.1]] changes.\n* The basic attack portion of the active's explosion is a standard basic attack, just in an area of effect. It is affected by {{tip|critical strike}} modifiers and other effects that interact with basic attacks, such as {{ii|Plated Steelcaps}}.\n** Keep in mind that {{tip|on-attack}} effects are only applied once per basic attack, not per target hit.\n'''Interactions & Other'''\n* ''Starfire Spellblade'' can behave both as a {{tip|ranged}} and {{tip|melee}} attack based on how far the target is prior to '''Kayle''' ascending to {{ai|Divine Ascent|Kayle|Arisen}}, after which the attack will be always using ranged standards.\n** If the target is 200 units away or closer, the attack will be considered melee.\n** If the target is over 200 units, the attack will be considered ranged. To further expand on this: Using the ranged empowered attack will change '''Kayle's''' range type to ranged while the projectile is alive. This means that if the target could outrun the projectile, '''Kayle''' will be stuck on being ranged, although the bonuses are not kept.\n* While the effect is active a circle is visible to '''Kayle''', indicating her {{sti|range}}, however, this circle only takes into account {{ais|Divine Ascent|Kayle}} effect on her range, not other sources such as {{ii|Rapid Firecannon}}.\n** The increased range will be {{sti|range|675}} prior to ascending to {{sbc|Transcendent}}, after which it's {{sti|range|725}}.\n* Single-use on-hits, such as {{tip|Spellblade}}, will be applied to the main target.\n** If the main target died prior to the projectile reaching them, or if it was a [[Jungle plants|jungle plant]], the effects will be applied to the closest target from the explosion's center.\n* {{iis|Guinsoo's Rageblade}} {{nie|Phantom Hit}} can only be applied to the main target.\n* Despite being one cast instance, ''Starfire Spellblade'' triggers {{iis|Muramana}} {{nie|Shock}} twice, dealing normal bonus damage after the basic attack and increased bonus damage after the spell, totalling at {{as|{{as|{{rd|{{fd|5}}%|{{fd|4.2}}%}} '''maximum''' mana}} {{as|(+ 6% AD)}} '''bonus''' physical damage|physical damage}}.",
