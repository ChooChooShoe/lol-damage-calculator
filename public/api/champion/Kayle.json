      "notes": "'''Zealous'''\n* The stacking {{as|attack speed}} is tracked via a buff called [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal''', while the maximum stacks bonus grants the buff [[File:Divine Ascent.png|20px|link=]] '''Exalted'''.\n* All sources of {{as|ability power}} will increase the amount of {{as|attack speed}} gained by [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal''' stacks until ascending to {{sbc|Transcendent}}.\n** Each stack grants {{as|attack speed}} based on the amount of {{as|ability power}} '''Kayle''' has at the time the stack is acquired. For example, if a stack is acquired while '''Kayle''' has {{sti|{{as|100 ability power}}}}, it will grant {{sti|{{as|7% attack speed}}}}. If an additional {{sti|{{as|100 ability power}}}} is gained immediately afterwards (for a total of {{sti|{{as|200|ability power}}}}), the next stack will grant {{sti|attack speed|{{as|8%|attack speed}}}}. If all {{as|ability power}} is then immediately lost, the next stack will only grant {{sti|attack speed|{{as|6%|attack speed}}}}.\n* If '''Kayle''' is in her attack animation after the stacks expire, she gains another {{fd|0.5}} seconds to refresh/stack [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal'''.\n'''Arisen'''\n* Basic attacks within {{sti|range|175}} will still use '''Kayle's''' melee basic attack animations and do not utilize {{tip|projectile|projectiles}}.\n** They are still classified as {{tip|ranged}} attacks.\n** Due to this fact, projectile blocking effects cannot intercept basic attacks while '''Kayle's''' target is within her \"melee\" range.\n'''Aflame'''\n* Basic attacks against [[structures]] do not trigger fire waves.\n* While at 4 stacks of [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal''', the next {{tip|on-attack}} reaching the fifth stack will be empowered by {{sbc|Aflame}}, releasing the first fire wave.\n'''Transcendent'''\n* [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal''' and [[File:Divine Ascent.png|20px|link=]] '''Exalted''' buffs swapped to a new buff that grants the benefit of both and it is not visible on Kayle's HUD.\n** The {{as|attack speed}} no longer needs to be stacked up and will be always on maximum value.\n** This buff also updates its {{as|attack speed}} value whenever a stat update happens and {{as|ability power}} is changed. However, some sources of {{as|ability power}} are no longer tracked, unlike with [[File:Zealous.png|20px|link=]] '''Zeal'''. The following sources becomes invalid:\n*** [[Rune]]s\n*** {{bi|Infernal Might}}\n*** {{cai|W|Yuumi}}\n*** {{ii|Staff of Flowing Water}}\n'''Fire waves details'''\n* [[File:Celestine Wish Kayle Fire Wave.png|thumb|Hitboxes shows by a graph side by side.]] A wave consists of three projectiles for the hitbox and a fourth for visuals.\n* The hitbox projectiles spawn 75 units behind '''Kayle''', travel through her, and are destroyed once they've traveled 850 units. Their technical details are:\n** {{sbc|Range:}} {{tip|cr|850}} (755 effective)\n** {{sbc|Width:}} {{tip|er|200}}\n** {{sbc|Projectile Speed:}} 2800\n** {{sbc|Angle:}} 18{{degree}} (left and right at 9{{degree}} to their side, respectively)\n* {{tip|Projectile}} blocking effects can block each projectile individually.\n** It is possible to block the visuals, but still get hit by an unblocked \"invisible\" hitbox projectile.\n* Hitting an enemy with multiple projectiles of the same wave will not increase the damage dealt.\n* Fire waves roll {{tip|critical strike|critical strike chance}} on each target hit individually.\n'''Interactions & Other'''\n* Both the stacking and launching a fire wave is an {{tip|on-attack}} effect that is triggered whenever '''Kayle''' completes her {{tip|attack windup}}.\n* The fire wave shares {{tip|cast instance}} with the triggering basic attack.\n** The amount of {{ri|Conqueror}} stacks gained will be 1 if the basic attack deals damage first or 2 if the wave does so.\n* Keep in mind that it's still two damage instances. If one triggers {{ri|Bone Plating}}, the other's damage will be blocked.\n* Because '''Kayle''' is both a {{tip|melee}} and {{tip|ranged}} champion, she can purchase both ranged and melee exclusive items at anytime, but their effects will function depending on her current range type; the same principle also applies to [[runes]].\n* Waves are fired in the direction that '''Kayle''' is facing. Changing that during the early animation via {{si|Flash}} will also change the direction of the wave.\n* Each ascension has an unique animation and a voice line. ''([https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Kayle/LoL/Audio See: Kayle's quotes])''\n* The ascensions' animation will override the current one, but it does not cancel '''Kayle's''' current action, nor her previous orders.",
