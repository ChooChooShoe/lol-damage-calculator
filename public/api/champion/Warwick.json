It does not accept two-click input (e.g. First Cast and Recast) that abilities like {{ai|Piercing Arrow|Varus}} or {{ai|Decimating Smash|Sion}} use in Standard Casting.\n* The bite always occurs after the same delay, however the time spent lunging does not, which depends based on the range ''Jaw of the Beast'' was cast away from the target, up to a lunge duration of {{fd|0.5}} seconds.\n** The lunge duration does not affect the {{tip|lockout}} timer on '''Warwick''', which is the same of the bite.\n** '''Warwick's''' lunge always places him to his {{sti|attack range|{{as|attack range}}}} to the center of his target.\n* '''Warwick's''' dash will place him up to the edge of his {{sti|attack range|{{as|attack range}}}} from the target.\n* '''Warwick''' will attempt to basic attack the target after a short delay.\n* The following table refers for interactions while '''Warwick''' is {{tip|channel|channeling}}:\n{{ct|channel|attack = false|cast = {{ai|Primal Howl|Warwick}} is usable. {{ai|Blood Hunt|Warwick}} and {{ai|Infinite Duress|Warwick}} are disabled.|move=false|spells=true,interrupts,interrupts,interrupts,interrupts|items=interrupts,true,interrupts,false,interrupts,melee|consume=true}}",
