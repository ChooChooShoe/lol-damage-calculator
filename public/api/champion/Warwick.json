The ability can be still held, however, '''Warwick''' is no longer eligible for the refund in this case.\n** The refund can occasionally fail. {{bug}}\n* As mentioned, ''Jaws of the Beast's'' heal is calculated only from its own damage dealt. Additional damage effects, such as {{tip|on-hit|on-hits}}, are not.\n* If the cast started beforehand, both the damage and the heal occur even after '''Warwick's''' {{tip|death}}, or during {{tip|resurrection}}.\n* It has been special cased so '''Warwick''' does not follow an enemy's {{si|Recall}} or a {{ci|Sion}} that revives from {{ai|I|Sion}}, unless they're first bitten (they're not followed if they recall before '''Warwick''' reaches them).\n* ''Jaws of the Beast's'' channel cannot be initiated while {{tip|ground|grounded}} or {{tip|root|rooted}}. '''Warwick''' can only use the normal cast.\n** The channel will '''not''' be interrupted by either of the two effects, despite the lock-on being a [[Channel#Movement Channels|movement channel]].\n* The bite always occurs after the same delay, however the time spent lunging does not, which depends based on the range ''Jaw of the Beast'' was cast away from the target, up to a lunge duration of {{fd|0.5}} seconds.\n** The lunge duration does not affect the {{tip|lockout}} timer on, which is the same as the bite's delay.\n** '''Warwick's''' lunge always places him to his attack range to the center of his target.\n* '''Warwick's''' dash will place him up to the edge of his attack range from the target.\n'''Interactions & Other'''\n* In order to hit the cap, the target monster needs to have at least {{as|{{ap|(100 to 200)/((6 to 10)/100)|round=ceil}} health}}.\n* ''Jaws of the Beast'' is the only ability in the game that combines {{tip|channel|channeling}} with {{tip|displacement immune|displacement immunity}}. Every {{tip|interrupt|interrupting}} crowd control effect that is not resisted by the displacement immunity will prematurely stop the {{tip|dash}}.\n** The bite can still occur if cast before the crowd control application, but '''Warwick''' cannot start channeling.\n** Abilities that apply both {{tip|stun}} and {{tip|airborne}} at the same time cause '''Warwick''' to ignore the displacement, but prematurely stop the channel and the dash.\n** The only exception to this is {{cai|I|Sion}}.\n* '''Warwick''' will follow enemies that move via {{tip|attach|attachment}} effects but the lock-on will '''not''' be extended.\n* While ''Jaws of the Beast'' does not use Quick Casting by default, click-and-hold is comparable to the input required to use {{ai|Bone Skewer|Pyke}} or {{ai|Comet Spear|Pantheon}}. It does not accept two-click input (e.g. First Cast and Recast) that abilities like {{ai|Piercing Arrow|Varus}} or {{ai|Decimating Smash|Sion}} use in Standard Casting.\n* '''Warwick''' will attempt to basic attack the target after a short delay.\n* The following table refers for interactions while '''Warwick''' is {{tip|channel|channeling}}:\n{{ct|charge|attack = false|cast = {{ai|Primal Howl|Warwick}} is usable. {{ai|Blood Hunt|Warwick}} and {{ai|Infinite Duress|Warwick}} are disabled.|move=false|spells=true,interrupts,interrupts,interrupts,interrupts|items=interrupts,true,interrupts,false,interrupts,melee|consume=true}}\n'''Known Issues'''\n* ''Jaws of the Beast'' will also refund its {{sti|cooldown}} if it kills the target after being held for exactly its bite delay. {{bug|1|Started in patch 10.1}}\n* The ability can be shortly cast on a dead target, with the ability going on cooldown.{{bug|1|Started in patch 10.1}}",
