However, grabbing it before ''Sion'' initially dies causes the '''''{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}''''' to remain during ''Sion's'' ''Glory in Death'', thus still being able to become a '''''{{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}'''''.\n* The target will only get slowed after the tether returns back to it and not instantly.\n* Only '''Illaoi''' can see who's been '''''{{as|Vesseled|buzzword3}}'''''.\n* Redirected damage is calculated by taking the premitigation damage, applying it to ''Test of Spirit's'' modifier, and then cap it to the '''''{{as|Spirit's|buzzword}}''''' {{as|'''current''' health}}. This damage will then be affected by damage modifiers of the enemy champion.\n** The damage shown being received by the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} is not representative of the damage redirected to the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}, as the combat text shown adjacent to the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} factors the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit's|buzzword}}}} modifiers - which may be different from the {{as|Vessel's|buzzword3}} (e.g different resistances, {{ri|Coup de Grace}}).\n*** Stacking {{ri|Press the Attack}} on the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} will only increase the damage against the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} and not against the enemy champion.\n** In a hypothetical situation, if both the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} as the target have 50% damage reduction from {{as|armor}}, the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} has {{as|500 HP}}, and it receives 1000 damage (before resistances), while ''Test of Spirit'' has 60% ratio, redirected damage won’t be 1000{{times}}0.6{{times}}0.5{{equals}}300 but it will be 1000{{times}}0.6{{equals}}600, is 600 less than 500 ({{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit's|buzzword}}}} {{as|'''current''' health}})? No, then redirected damage is 500{{times}}0.5{{equals}}250.<br>If instead of being dealt 1000 damage in 1 hit, it would've been dealt in 2 hits, 500 each, the results would have been these: 500{{times}}0.6{{equals}}300 less than 500 (Yes) 300{{times}}0.5{{equals}}150 redirected damage (first hit)<br>In the meantime the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} took 500{{times}}0.5{{equals}}250 damage<br>Same thing for second hit, 500{{times}}0.6{{equals}}300 less than 250(No) 250{{times}}0.5{{equals}}125 redirected damage (second hit)<br>The {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} reached {{as|0 HP}} because of having taken 250 damage twice.<br>Total redirected damage{{equals}}150{{plus}}125{{equals}}275\n*** Even if total damage dealt to the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} is the same in both cases, total redirected damage is higher if it's dealt with less powerful attacks.\n* Damage transferred to the target will apply damage-type specific effects such as {{ii|The Black Cleaver}}, {{ii|Morellonomicon}}, {{ii|Executioner's Calling}}, or the healing from {{ii|Death's Dance}} / {{ii|Hextech Gunblade}}, determined by who dealt the damage.\n** It will not trigger on-hit effects or spell effects versus the target ({{ri|Scorch}}, {{ii|Wit's End}}) although the damage of those effects dealt to the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} will be transferred.\n* Attacking both the enemy and its {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} at the same time will have the enemy receive only one {{ii|The Black Cleaver}} stack.\n* {{ii|Spellthief's Edge|Tribute}} and {{ri|Predator}} only reflect double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} (e.g if {{ri|Predator}} would deal 60 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 120 damage).\n* {{ri|Electrocute}} / {{ri|Phase Rush}} / {{ii|Spellthief's Edge|Tribute}} stacks can be put on the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} but redirected damage won't apply any stack on the enemy champion.\n* The redirected damage from triggering {{ri|Conqueror}} on the ''Spirit'' will benefit from the true damage and will be amplified by the bonus ad (the triggered ''Conqueror'' damage usually doesn't benefit from either).\n* Attacking the ''Spirit'' with {{ri|Conqueror}} will redirect {{fd|15.36%}} of the damage as {{tip|true damage}}, before ''Test of Spirit's'' modifier.\n* Runes statistics will consider the damage being done to the spirit.\n* {{ai|Riposte|Fiora}} can prevent from becoming a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} if used before the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} gets killed or while {{ai|Lunge|Fiora|lunging}} out of the tether's range.\n* If a champion is made a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} while {{ii|Guardian Angel|reviving}}, it will revive without being one.\n* If the target becomes a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} in a dormant {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God||{{as|Tentacle's|buzzword2}}}} attack range, that {{ai|Prophet of an Elder God||{{as|Tentacle|buzzword2}}}} will be prevented from doing its first attack.\n* Once the {{ai|Vessel||{{as|Spirit|buzzword}}}} vanishes (it doesn't need to be killed) '''Illaoi''' will get {{iis|Phage|Rage}} full movement speed bonus and 1 creep score in-game (the bonus cs won't be shown in the end of game screen).",
