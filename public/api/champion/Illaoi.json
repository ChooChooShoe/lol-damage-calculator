The {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} allies cannot manually select it as a valid target for spells and abilities, but they can still do so with automatically targetted effects. {{bug|1}}\n** {{as|Spirits|buzzword}} take 50% damage from [[turret]]s and do not cause turrets to {{ii|Ohmwrecker (Turret Item)|Warm Up}} their attacks. {{bug|1}}\n** {{as|Spirits|buzzword}} cannot be {{tip|heal|healed}} nor {{tip|shield|shielded}} ({{ri|Summon Aery}} excluded {{bug|1}}).\n** The {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} levels up when the {{as|Vessel|buzzword2}} does, gaining the target's stats per level. If the target has a resource that also increases per level (i.e {{tip|mana}}), the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} lifetime will increase instead. {{bug|1}}\n* The {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} destination is decided based on '''Illaoi's''' position and facing direction when the target is hit.\n* The {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is {{tip|untargetable}} while it is being pulled, and spawns with the tethered champion's default model and size.\n** The {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} lifetime is sometimes {{fd|0.25}} seconds longer, while its ''untargetability'' is sometimes shorter, causing {{as|Tentacles|buzzword2}} to hit an inconsistent amount of times.\n* Redirected damage is calculated by taking the pre-mitigation damage against the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}}, applying ''Test of Spirit's'' damage modifier, and then capping it to the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} {{as|'''current''' health}}. This damage will then be affected by damage modifiers (resistances and other effects) of the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}.\n** This order of operations allows ''Test of Spirit'' to deal more or less percentage of the {{as|Vessel's|buzzword3}} {{as|health}} than would be expected:\n**# Because the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} modifiers can be different from the {{as|Vessel's|buzzword3}}, and the damage being pre-mitigated, allowing the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} to have higher or lower [[health|effective health]], respectively increasing or decreasing the maximum achievable damage from killing it.\n**# Because the cap is supposed to block excess damage over the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} {{as|'''current''' health}}, which does not reliably do so or does too well, depending on whether the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} damage modifier is higher than ''Test of Spirit's'' or not, respectively. This causes an increasing difference of damage when the pre-mitigated damage is between <code>Spirit current health{{divided by}}Spiritmod</code> and <code>Spirit current health{{divided by}}Emod</code>. {{bug|1}}\n**#* To fix this case, pre-mitigated damage would need to be capped at the amount that kills the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}}, and only then have ''Test of Spirit's'' damage modifier apply.\n** '''Illaoi''' needs {{as|{{ap|(100-(25 to 45))/8*100}} '''total''' AD}} to reach 100% redirected damage. As per above, the damage is still dependent on the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} and {{as|Vessel's|buzzword3}} damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's '''current''' health as total redirected damage.\n* {{tip|Spell shield|Spell shields}} may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the ''slow'' upon becoming a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}. ''Spell shields'' will not prevent becoming a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} or {{as|Tentacles|buzzword2}} from attacking.\n* The tendril can be blocked by abilities such as {{cai|W|Yasuo}}, but the returning tether slow cannot, even if it can otherwise be {{tip|homing projectile destruction|destroyed}} by effects that can do so (i.e {{tip|untargetability}}).\n** The tether slow will not be fired if the target is already {{tip|untargetability|untargetable}} when the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} dies.\n* The spirit pull is not considered a {{tip|crowd control}} effect and will not be blocked by {{tip|cc-immune|crowd control immunity}}, with the exception of {{cai|E|Morgana}}.{{bug|2}}\n* The projectile tentacle model is linked to '''Illaoi's''' model animation and size. However gameplay wise it is not, thus the actual hitbox being different than the position, width and length of the visible model. {{bug|1}}\n** The model will stop mid-air / vanish if '''Illaoi''' goes into {{tip|stasis}}, {{tip|sleep}} or {{tip|airborne}}, however the actual hitbox will continue its trajectory unseen.\n** {{pending for test}} The projectile is however seen by enemies if '''Illaoi''' is not {{tip|Sight|visible}}. <!--just the projectile? or also Illaoi herself? Globally? Or does she need to be close to an enemy champion? Does she need to point the ability towards them? Or also if she points the other way?-->\n{{Effect at cast time end}}\n** And will fire towards the same pointed location.\n* Grabbing the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} of a champion before it goes into {{tip|resurrection}} via {{ai|R|Zilean}} or {{ii|Guardian Angel}} will spawn the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} with 0 health, making it {{tip|invulnerable}}. {{bug|1}}\n** The same does not happen with other ''resurrection'' effects (i.e {{cai|I|Karthus}}) since they leave the champion with more than 0 health.\n* Grabbing the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} of a champion with {{tip|Flow}} or {{tip|Ferocity}} will make the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear. {{bug|1}}\n* {{pending for test}} Grabbing the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} of an {{ai|R|Kalista|Oathsworn}} will make the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} invisible. {{bug|1}}\n* '''Illaoi''' is the only one able to see who's been {{as|Vesseled|buzzword3}}, by adding a layer of watery effects on their model. The {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} will also be let known it's debuffed, by having a layer of watery effects on its screen instead.\n** If the target becomes a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} while {{tip|vanish|vanished}}, the layer on their model will fail to be added. {{bug|1}}\n* The {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} status effect is a debuff that doesn't ''persist through death''.\n* If the target is made a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} while {{tip|resurrection|resurrecting}}, they will not revive as a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}.\n* Runes consider the {{as|Spirit|Buzzword}} as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking. {{bug|2}}\n** {{as|Tentacles|buzzword2}} damage with {{ri|First Strike}} only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} (e.g if {{ri|First Strike}} would deal 3 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 6 damage). {{bug|1}}\n* Transferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as {{ii|Black Cleaver}}, {{ii|Morellonomicon}}, {{ii|Executioner's Calling}}, {{ii|Riftmaker}}, {{bi|Aspect of the Dragon}} burn damage.\n** Redirected damage always counts as single target for the purpose of {{tip|Omnivamp}}.\n** The {{as|Spirit|Buzzword}} will also redirect the '''bonus''' damage dealt by ''Riftmaker'' and ''Aspect of the Dragon'', effectively double diping their damage to the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}. In particular, ''Riftmaker'' also further increases its own redirected damage, granting an additional {{fd|0.81%}} '''bonus''' damage at full stacks, for a total of {{fd|18.81%}}.\n** Transferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g. {{ii|Liandry's Anguish}}, {{ri|Phase Rush}} stacks). These effects are only applied versus the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}}.\n** Attacking the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} and its {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} simultaneously will only apply one stack of {{ii|Black Cleaver}} to the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}. {{bug|2}}\n* When the tether is broken (whether the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} lifetime ran out or the target moved out of range), the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} will {{tip|vanish}} and move to '''Illaoi's''' location.\n** An {{tip|uncancellable windup}} attack may still kill the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} after it ''vanished'' to grant the gold, but without making the target a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}.\n* The {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is immune to {{tip|stasis}} (i.e. {{cai|Tempered Fate|Bard}}).\n* {{cai|Riposte|Fiora}} can be used to prevent becoming a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} if used before the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is killed or while leaving the tether's range.\n* {{cis|Sion}} {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} cannot be spawned during {{ai|Glory in Death|Sion}}. {{as|Spirits|buzzword}} created before ''Sion's'' {{tip|zombie state}} will remain active.\n* If the target that had its {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} pulled from them is taken into the {{ai|Realm of Death|Mordekaiser}}, the tether will break, but they will not be made into a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}.\n* The following table refers for interactions while '''Illaoi''' is firing the projectile and while the target's {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is being pulled:\n{{ct|attack=false|move=false|cast={{ai|Q|Illaoi}} and {{ai|R|Illaoi}} are buffered. {{ai|W|Illaoi}} is usable, but is buffered while pulling the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}}. {{bug|2}}|items=false|consume=false|spells=true,false,false,false,false|interrupts=death}}",
