However, the projectile will not, and will be able to hit enemies away from its model position. It will also not be seen by enemies if '''Illaoi''' is not {{tip|Sight|visible}}, but it will be heard if the tentacle passes through their vision. \n* Using {{si|Flash}} during the cast time will change '''Illaoi's''' position but the tentacle will still be directed towards the previous pointed location.\n* Grabbing the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} of a champion that has their resource bar white (i.e {{tip|Flow}}) will make the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear.\n* Grabbing the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} of a target that is {{tip|camouflage|camouflaged}} while there’s a control ward revealing them will make the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} invisible.\n* Only '''Illaoi''' can see who's been {{as|Vesseled|buzzword3}}, with their model covered in watery effects. The {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} itself will instead have its screen covered in watery effects.\n* If the enemy champion is reviving when the conditions for becoming a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} are met, then they will not revive as a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}.\n* Runes consider the {{as|Spirit|Buzzword}} as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking.\n** {{ri|Predator}} only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} (e.g if {{ri|Predator}} would deal 60 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 120 damage).\n* Transferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as {{ii|The Black Cleaver}}, {{ii|Morellonomicon}}, {{ii|Executioner's Calling}}, {{bi|Aspect of the Dragon}} burn damage and the healing from {{ii|Death's Dance}} or {{ii|Hextech Gunblade}}.\n** Transferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g. {{ii|Liandry's Torment}}, {{ri|Phase Rush}} stacks). These effects are only applied versus the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}}.\n** Attacking the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} and its {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} simultaneously will only apply one {{ii|The Black Cleaver}} to the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}.\n* Once the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} vanishes, whether defeated or not, '''Illaoi''' will get {{iis|Phage|Rage}} full movement speed bonus and 1 creep score in-game (not included in the post-game counter).\n* The {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is immune to {{tip|stasis}} (i.e. {{cai|Tempered Fate|Bard}}).\n* {{cai|Riposte|Fiora}} can be used to prevent becoming a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} if used before the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is killed or while leaving the tether's range.\n* {{cis|Sion}} {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} cannot be spawned during {{ai|Glory in Death|Sion}}. {{as|Spirits|buzzword}} created before ''Sion's'' undeath will remain active.",
