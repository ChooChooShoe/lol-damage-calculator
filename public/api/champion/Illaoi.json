The {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} allies cannot target it.\n** {{as|Spirits|buzzword}} take 50% damage from [[turret]]s and do not cause turrets to {{ii|Ohmwrecker (Turret Item)|Warm Up}} their attacks.\n** {{as|Spirits|buzzword}} cannot be {{tip|heal|healed}} nor {{tip|shield|shielded}} ({{ri|Summon Aery}} excluded).\n** The {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} levels up when the {{as|Vessel|buzzword2}} does. Doing so will increase the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} {{as|health}}, {{as|armor}}, and {{as|magic resist}}, and additionally extend its lifetime by 1 second.\n* The {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is {{tip|untargetable}} while it is being pulled.\n* Redirected damage is calculated by taking the pre-mitigation damage, applying ''Test of Spirit's'' damage modifier, and then capping it to the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} {{as|'''current''' health}}. This damage will then be affected by damage modifiers (resistances and other effects) of the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}.\n** This means that the damage received by the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is not representative of the damage redirected to the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}, as each calculates their damage taken based on their respective modifiers.\n** If the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} damage modifier is lower than the {{as|Vessel's|buzzword3}}, it will cause an increase in total redirected damage, else it will cause a decrease.\n** If the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} damage modifier is higher than ''Test of Spirit's'', it will cause an increase in total redirected damage, else it will cause a decrease. The difference in damage is up to a cap.\n** '''Illaoi''' needs {{as|{{ap|(100-(25 to 45))/8*100}} '''total''' AD}} to reach 100% redirected damage. As per above, the damage is still dependent on the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} and {{as|Vessel's|buzzword3}} damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's '''current''' health as total redirected damage.\n* {{tip|Spell shield|Spell shields}} may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the ''slow'' upon becoming a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}. ''Spell shields'' will not prevent becoming a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} or {{as|Tentacles|buzzword2}} from attacking.\n* The tendril can be blocked by abilities such as {{cai|W|Yasuo}}, but the returning tether slow cannot, even if it can otherwise be {{tip|homing projectile destruction|destroyed}} by effects that can do so (i.e {{tip|untargetability}}).\n** The tether slow will not be fired if the target is already {{tip|untargetability|untargetable}} when the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} dies.\n* The spirit pull is not considered a {{tip|crowd control}} effect and will not be blocked by {{tip|cc-immune|crowd control immunity}}, with the exception of {{cai|E|Morgana}}.{{bug|2}}\n* If the target becomes a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} within range of a dormant {{as|Tentacle|buzzword2}}, that {{as|Tentacle|buzzword2}} will skip its first attack.\n* The tentacle model of the first cast is connected to '''Illaoi's''' body and will stop moving when '''Illaoi''' does (e.g {{tip|stasis}}, {{tip|sleep}}, {{tip|airborne}}). However, the projectile will not, and will be able to hit enemies away from its model position. It will also not be seen by enemies if '''Illaoi''' is not {{tip|Sight|visible}}, but it will be heard if the tentacle passes through their vision.\n* ''Test of Spirit'' will fire from wherever '''Illaoi''' is at the end of the cast time towards the same pointed location.\n* Grabbing the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} of a champion before it goes into {{tip|resurrection}} via {{ai|R|Zilean}} or {{ii|Guardian Angel}} will spawn the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} with 0 health, making it {{tip|invulnerable}}.\n** The same does not happen with other ''resurrection'' effects (i.e {{cai|I|Karthus}}) since they leave the champion with more than 0 health.\n* Grabbing the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} of a champion with {{tip|Flow}} or {{tip|Ferocity}} will make the {{as|Spirit's|buzzword}} lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear.\n* Grabbing the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} of an {{ai|R|Kalista|Oathsworn}}, or of a champion that is {{tip|camouflage|camouflaged}} while they are being revealed by a {{ii|Control Ward}}, will make the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} invisible.\n* Only '''Illaoi''' can see who's been {{as|Vesseled|buzzword3}}, with their model covered in watery effects. The {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} itself will instead have its screen covered in watery effects.\n* The {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} status effect is a debuff that doesn't ''persist through death''.\n* If the enemy champion is {{tip|resurrection|resurrecting}} when the conditions for becoming a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} are met, then they will not revive as a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}.\n* Runes consider the {{as|Spirit|Buzzword}} as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking.\n** {{ri|Predator}} only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} (e.g if {{ri|Predator}} would deal 60 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 120 damage).\n* Transferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as {{ii|Black Cleaver}}, {{ii|Morellonomicon}}, {{ii|Executioner's Calling}}, {{ii|Riftmaker}}, {{bi|Aspect of the Dragon}} burn damage.\n** The {{as|Spirit|Buzzword}} will also redirect the '''bonus''' damage dealt by ''Riftmaker'' and ''Aspect of the Dragon'', effectively double diping their damage to the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}. In particular, ''Riftmaker'' also further increases its own redirected damage, granting an additional {{fd|0.81%}} '''bonus''' damage at full stacks, for a total of {{fd|18.81%}}.\n* {{Pending for test}}: Healing from {{tip|Omnivamp}}\n** Transferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g. {{ii|Liandry's Anguish}}, {{ri|Phase Rush}} stacks). These effects are only applied versus the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}}.\n** Attacking the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} and its {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} simultaneously will only apply one stack of {{ii|Black Cleaver}} to the {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}.\n* Once the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} vanishes, whether defeated or not, '''Illaoi''' will get 1 creep score in-game (not included in the post-game counter).\n* The {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is immune to {{tip|stasis}} (i.e. {{cai|Tempered Fate|Bard}}).\n* {{cai|Riposte|Fiora}} can be used to prevent becoming a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}} if used before the {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is killed or while leaving the tether's range.\n* {{cis|Sion}} {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} cannot be spawned during {{ai|Glory in Death|Sion}}. {{as|Spirits|buzzword}} created before ''Sion's'' {{tip|zombie state}} will remain active.\n* If the target that had its {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} pulled from them is taken into the {{ai|Realm of Death|Mordekaiser}}, the tether will break, but they will not be made into a {{as|Vessel|buzzword3}}.\n* The following table refers for interactions while '''Illaoi''' is firing the projectile and while the target's {{as|Spirit|buzzword}} is being pulled:\n{{ct|attack=false|move=false|cast=false|items=false|consume=false|spells=true,false,false,false,false|interrupts=death}}",
