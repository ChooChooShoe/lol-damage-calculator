This matters for effects that are consumed on-hit (e.g. {{ii|Duskblade of Draktharr}}, {{nie|Spellblade}}), which are applied to the target with the lowest {{tt|Spawn ID|among champions, this would also be the enemy first pick in Blind Pick mode}}.\n** \"Spawn ID\" is an unofficial abbreviation to describe the spawn order for all units at the beginning of games, below are some examples.\n** If '''Senna''' targets an enemy champion but hits at least one more enemy champion simultaneously, {{ris|Press the Attack}} first stack will be applied to that target. If no champion was targeted, it will default to the champion with the lowest Spawn ID out of the ones struck by the ability. Whether the effect stacks up on a champion or not when multiple enemy champions are stuck also depends on Spawn ID.\n** If ''Piercing Darkness'' struck an enemy champion and turret simultaneously, with {{ii|Rapid Firecannon}} fully charged, the passive effect will most likely proc on the turret since towers are often spawned before champions.\n* Since ''Piercing Darkness'' is treated as a basic attack to {{tip|turret|turrets}}, its damage is valid for the [[Turret#Damaging_turrets|damage conversion]] from {{as|physical|physical damage}} to {{as|magic|magic damage}} when attacking them.\n* {{tip|Spell shield}} will not prevent on-hit effects from being applied.\n* {{Pending for test}}: ''Piercing Darkness'' interaction with {{tip|dodge|dodging}}, {{tip|block|blocking}}, and {{tip|blind|blinding}} effects.",

      "notes": "* '''Senna''' can move while casting.\n* Allies affected by the ''Curse of the Blast Mist'' aura receive a buff called ''Cloak of Mist''.\n* Obscured units appear as ''Wraiths'', hence the name. The wraith model does not distinguish which champion is obscured.\n** On the [[Map (League of Legends)|mini-map]], obscured champions will be displayed as wraith icons instead of champion icons to the enemy team.\n* In-game, the 'Cloak of Mist' buff grants camouflage and the 'Wraith Form' buff obscures the unit and grants movement speed. However, 'Cloak of Mist' has the unspecified effect of negating the obscuring effects of 'Wraith Form' (i.e. the unit is not a wraith while inside the mist); the unit has the bonus movement speed even when they are not a wraith (e.g. inside the mist or an enemy is nearby); and 'Wraith Form' also grants the functionality of camouflage (i.e. the unit is treated as a camouflaged unit with regards to {{tip|True Sight}}, {{ii|Control Ward|Control Wards}}, and enemy {{tip|champions}}).\n** Given this overly complex interaction between the two buffs granted as well as the overlapping effects, it is easier to describe the effects as a single buff that is modified in specific circumstances rather than trying to establish a new game mechanic.\n** '''Senna''' likewise has her aura buff and the 'Wraith Form' buff, but her 'Wraith Form' does not share gameplay functionality with other allies benefiting from Wraith Form. For '''Senna''', the appearance of being a wraith is a form-swap while camouflaged (similar to {{cai|Demon Shade|Evelynn}}). '''Senna''' will remain in her wraith form when she is detected so long as the camouflage effect isn't broken, and her wraith's appearance is very distinct from other wraiths.\n* {{ii|Oracle's Extract}} has no effect on champions with the ''Cloak of Mist'' buff, even though Oracle's Extract has a range of 500, while the camouflage detection radius is only 400.\n* Allied champions who enter the mist and have {{tip|stealth}} of their own will still gain the ''Wraith Form'' buff but they will not grant {{tip|obscured vision}} of themselves to the enemy while out of the mist nor will they appear as a ''Wraith''.\n** Allies who have their own {{tip|camouflage}} and also have ''Wraith Form'' will be revealed to enemies from their stealth's detection range, not ''Wraith Form's''.\n* ''Curse of the Black Mist'' will not activate if '''Senna''' enters {{tip|resurrection}} during the cast time.\n* ''Wraith Form'' will not be granted to allies that are in a {{tip|zombie state}} or are {{tip|channel|channeling}}. It will be granted to allies even if they are {{tip|untargetable}}.",
