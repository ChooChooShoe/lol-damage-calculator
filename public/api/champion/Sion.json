When it has ended, he will revive instantly, which can result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.\n* ''Glory in Death'' does not trigger on [[Decoy|clones]] of '''Sion''', such as with {{ai|Test of Spirit|Illaoi}}.\n* Upon death, '''Sion''' will drop 'most' non-permanent buffs and debuffs before transitioning into ''Glory in Death''. These effects include undisplayed statuses, for example the 'already stunned by this'-flag of {{cai|Event Horizon|Veigar}} or {{cai|Gravity Field|Viktor}}.\n** '''Sion''''s transition will not remove effects that presist through death, such as {{cai|Blaze|Brand}}.\n* All projectiles targeting '''Sion''' are destroyed at the start of becoming {{tip|untargetable}}.\n** Projectiles created after the fact will still travel to '''Sion''', but only affect him if he's no longer untargetable.\n* If a projectile is targeting Sion at the end of ''Glory in Death'' and he revives instantly, it will not be destroyed.\n* At the start of ''Glory in Death'', '''Sion's''' mana drops to 0, but will still be affected by mana restoration.\n* During ''Glory in Death'' '''Sion''': \n** Has all sources of self-healing other than {{sti|life steal}} and {{sti|spell vamp}} reduced by 100%.\n*** This includes item passives such as {{ii|Hextech Gunblade}} and {{iis|Blade of the Ruined King}} special lifesteal-affected on-hit, as well as runes such as {{ri|Ravenous Hunter}}.\n*** {{iis|Spirit Visage}} unique passive is unaffected and furthermore 'lowers' this reduction to 70% due to the way it factors in.\n** ''Can'' {{tip|critical strike|critically strike}}, but will use no special animation and no special sound effect.\n** ''Can'' use [[Active ability items|item actives]].\n** ''Cannot'' use [[summoner spell]]s.\n** ''Cannot'' take {{ai|Dark Passage|Thresh}}.\n** ''Cannot'' be targeted by {{ai|Devour|Tahm Kench}}.\n** ''Can'' use {{ai|Magical Journey|Bard}}.\n* '''Sion's''' attack speed during ''Glory in Death'' is fixed at {{fd|1.75}} and it's unaffected by attack speed slows/buffs for the duration.\n** Buffs that allow for the normal {{fd|2.5}} attack speed cap to be broken, such as {{ri|Lethal Tempo}} and {{ri|Hail of Blades}}, will also break the upper limit of the {{fd|1.75}} cap, but not the lower one. This means that while these buffs are active, '''Sion''' can exceed {{fd|1.75}} attack speed, but cannot fall below it.\n** After the effect ends, the attack speed cap will not revert to {{fd|1.75}} but to {{fd|2.5}}. However '''Sion''' will still not be able to go below {{as|{{fd|1.75}} attack speed}}.\n* Buffs from jungle monsters '''Sion''' gains during ''Glory in Death'' ({{bi|Crest of Cinders}}, {{bi|Crest of Insight}}) will not be lost once the duration ends.\n* By surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, '''Sion''' will suffer {{as|{{pp|key=k|36.3654 to 345.4713|round=1}}|health}} self-damage.\n* After ''Glory in Death'' ends, the corpse of '''Sion''' will retain body block despite being dead on the ground.\n* Even though its visuals are present, {{ri|Dark Harvest}} can never be gained from '''Sion''' under the effect of ''Glory in Death''.\n* '''Sion''' cannot {{si|Recall}} while under the effect of ''Glory in Death''.\n* The effect that heals '''Sion''' back to full health at the start of ''Glory in Death'' cannot be modified by {{tip|Grievous Wounds|healing reductions}} and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.",

      "notes": "* When ''Sion'' casts ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' a global warning can be heard.\n* ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' does not remove any active [[crowd control]] (e.g [[nearsight]]), however, '''Sion''' remains fully immune to crowd control through the whole effect including the final ''leap''. For example, striking ''Sion'' with {{ai|Blinding Dart|Teemo}} right before the effect ends will not cause him to be blinded when the ''charge'' or ''leap'' finishes.\n** After starting the ''charge'' '''Sion's''' movement speed cannot be artificially changed.\n* After reaching maximum damage and stun duration (at 3 seconds) '''Sion''' will transition from using his ''haste'' animation to his unique ''charging'' one.\n** Reaching the threshold on '''Mecha Zero Sion''' changes his particle effects instead, most notably the 'Boosters' behind the train.\n* {{Pending for test}} The maximum turning angle (per distance traveled) of the ''charge'' is constant. The turning radius is a constant value, estimated at roughly 2500 units.\n** This is not true when starting at insanely high values of movement speed; '''Sion''' will be facing the direction of the cast in his ''idle'' animation and turn at a much lower rate based on the speed he started with until his speed returns to the usual 950 MS limit.\n** That the turning angle is not based on time can easily be seen in practice when a '''Sion''' ''charges'' in-place due to bugs.\n* '''Sion''' does not always crash with terrain immediately upon touching it, enabling the player to turn beyond his maximum turning angle.\n** Casting the ability at point blank of a terrain will most often automatically change the ''charge's'' direction.\n** This is not usually possible with player-generated terrain.\n** Uniquely, colliding with '''allied''' {{ii|Zz'Rot Portal|Zz'Rot Portals}} during the ''charge'' does not cause '''Sion''' to stop but instead redirect him. Completely surrounding Sion with '''allied''' {{ii|Zz'Rot Portal|Zz'Rot Portals}} will cause ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' to ''charge'' in place once a Portal is touched, until it ends or a hole in the formation is opened.\n* ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' cannot ''charge'' through but can ''leap'' over player-created terrain (i.e {{ai|Crystallize|Anivia}}, {{ii|Zz'Rot Portal}}).\n** The charge will not collide with an ''allied'' {{ai|Emperor's Divide|Azir}}.\n* {{Pending for test}} The distance between '''Sion's''' center and the center of the ground ''slam'' scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of ''charge'' time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug.\n* {{Pending for test}} The ''leap'' appears to always have the same speed regardless of '''Sion's''', at roughly 750.\n* Hovering the cursor on the HUD (e.g minimap / champion portraits) does not affect the cast and steering of ''Unstoppable Onslaught''.\n* Even though the ability doesn't have a distance limit, casting the ability outside its ''cast range'' (7500 units), will have '''Sion''' attempt to walk in range before ''charging''.\n* Even though the [[cooldown]] of ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' starts at the end of the effect, gaining or losing [[Cooldown reduction|CDR]], or upgrading the ability during the effect, will not change the resuming cooldown.\n** However, gaining {{ris|Presence of Mind}} effect during ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' does result in a lowered cooldown.",
