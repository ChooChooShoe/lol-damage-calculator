Afterwards, he is still unable to use them until he respawns or after a lock-out effect (excluding {{tip|crowd control}} except {{tip|stasis}}) unlocks them.\n* {{ai|Chronoshift|Zilean}} and {{ii|Guardian Angel}} will take priority over ''Glory in Death''.\n* '''Sion's''' death timer starts ticking when he first {{tip|death|dies}} and not when ''Glory in Death's'' duration ends.\n** If '''Sion''' lives longer than his death timer lasts for, he will not revive until ''Glory in Death'' has ended. When it has ended, he will revive instantly, which can result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.\n* ''Glory in Death'' does not trigger on [[Decoy|clones]] of '''Sion''', such as with {{ai|Test of Spirit|Illaoi}}.\n* ''Glory in Death's'' {{tip|untargetability}} from the {{tip|stasis (buff)|stasis}} does not {{tip|homing projectile destruction|destroy}} in-flight {{tip|projectiles}}.\n** Projectiles created while while '''Sion''' is in the zombie form will still travel to him even after he dies.\n* At the start of ''Glory in Death'', '''Sion's''' {{tip|mana}} drops to 0, but his {{sti|mana regeneration|{{as|mana regeneration}}}} will remain in effect.\n* During ''Glory in Death'' '''Sion''': \n** Has all sources of {{tip|heal|healing}} reduced by 100% with the exception of {{stil|life steal}} and {{stil|spell vamp}}.\n*** This includes item passives such as {{iis|Blade of the Ruined King}} special lifesteal-affected on-hit, as well as [[Runes Reforged|runes]] such as {{ri|Ravenous Hunter}}.\n*** {{iis|Spirit Visage}} unique passive (specifically before [[V10.23]]) is unaffected and furthermore 'lowers' this reduction to 70% for [[health regeneration]] due to the way it factors in.\n** ''Can:''\n*** {{tip|critical strike|Critically strike}}.\n*** Use all [[Active ability items|item actives]], except {{ii|Refillable Potion}} and {{ii|Corrupting Potion}}.\n*** Use {{ai|Magical Journey|Bard}}.\n*** Be targeted by {{ai|Stand United|Shen}}.\n*** Be dragged and carried by {{ai|Fate's Call|Kalista}}.\n**** '''Sion''' will not lose health during this time.\n** ''Cannot:''\n*** Channel {{si|Recall}}.\n*** Enter {{tip|resurrection}} (e.g. via {{ii|Guardian Angel}}).\n*** Use {{ccib|Summoner spell icon.png|summoner spells}}.\n*** Take {{ai|Abyssal Voyage|Tahm Kench}} nor {{ai|Dark Passage|Thresh}}.\n*** Be targeted by {{ai|Chronoshift|Zilean}}, {{ai|Devour|Tahm Kench}}, nor {{ai|Umbral Trespass|Kayn}}.\n**** He cannot be targeted by {{ai|Fate's Call|Kalista}} while in the {{tip|stasis (buff)|stasis}} portion of ''Glory in Death'' (if he does, by any circumstance, he will emerge immediately).\n*** Be taken into the {{ai|Realm of Death|Mordekaiser}}.\n*** Be affected by {{ai|Fear Beyond Death 2|Urgot|Fear Beyond Death}} (recast), {{ai|Curse of the Black Mist|Senna}}, nor {{ai|Lamb's Respite|Kindred}}.\n*** Have his spirit be pulled by {{ai|Test of Spirit|Illaoi}}.\n*** Pick up the {{ii|Eye of the Herald}}.\n*** Take the [[Catapult]].\n* Trying to cast item actives during the initial stasis will buffer their casts instead, unless '''Sion''' issues another command before being able to act again.\n** Exception: [[File: Quicksilver Sash item.png|20px|link=]] {{nie|Quicksilver}} can be used during the stasis after death.\n* '''Sion's''' attack speed during ''Glory in Death'' is fixed at {{fd|1.75}} and it's unaffected by {{as|attack speed}} bonuses and {{tip|cripple|cripples}} for the duration.\n** Buffs that allow for the normal {{fd|2.5}} attack speed cap to be surpassed, such as {{ri|Lethal Tempo}} and {{ri|Hail of Blades}}, will also break the upper limit of the {{fd|1.75}} cap, but not the lower one. This means that while these [[buff]]s are active, '''Sion''' can exceed {{fd|1.75}} attack speed, but cannot fall below it.\n** After the effect ends, the attack speed cap will not revert to {{fd|1.75}} but to {{fd|2.5}}. However '''Sion''' will still not be able to go below {{as|{{fd|1.75}} attack speed}}.\n* Buffs from jungle monsters '''Sion''' gains during ''Glory in Death'' ({{bi|Crest of Cinders}}, {{bi|Crest of Insight}}) will not be lost once the duration ends.\n* By surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, '''Sion''' will have suffered {{as|{{pp|key=k|36.3654 to 345.4713|round=1}}|health}} in health costs.\n* After ''Glory in Death'' ends, the corpse of '''Sion''' will retain [[unit collision]] despite being dead on the ground.\n* Even though its visuals are present, {{ri|Dark Harvest}} can never be gained from '''Sion''' under the effect of ''Glory in Death''.\n* The effect that heals '''Sion''' back to full health at the start of ''Glory in Death'' cannot be modified by {{tip|Grievous Wounds|healing reductions}} and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.\n* ''Glory in Death's'' [[on-hit]] effect also applies against structures other than {{tip|turrets}}. {{bug}}",

There is no other difference between normal cast and quick cast for this ability, either.\n*The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as {{tip|Spellblade}} and stacking {{ai|Force Pulse|Kassadin}}.\n**The recast does not.\n* An enemy can only be affected by ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' once every 1 second.\n* After reaching maximum damage and stun duration (at 3 seconds) '''Sion''' will transition from using his ''haste'' animation to his unique ''charging'' one.\n** Reaching the threshold on {{csl|Sion|Mecha Zero}} changes his particle effects instead, most notably the 'Boosters' behind the vehicle.\n** The turning angle is not based on time and can easily be seen in practice when a '''Sion''' ''charges'' in-place due to bugs.\n* {{cai|I|Nami}} is the only known effect that can affect '''Sion's''' {{as|movement speed}} during the ''charge'' and that can place him above the normal MS value. However, without further multipliers, surpassing the {{as|950 movement speed}} cap will require {{ci|Nami}} to have over {{as|2150 ability power}}.\n* '''Sion''' does not always crash with terrain immediately upon touching it, enabling the player to turn beyond his maximum turning angle.\n** Casting the ability at point blank of a terrain will most often automatically change the ''charge's'' direction.\n** This is not usually possible with player-generated terrain.\n* ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' cannot ''charge'' through but can ''leap'' over player-created terrain (i.e {{ai|Crystallize|Anivia}}).\n* '''Sion''' loses the {{tip|cc-immune|crowd control immunity}} after finishing the {{tip|lunge|leap}}.\n* '''Sion''' is not immune to {{tip|crowd control}} applied by his allies during ''Unstoppable Onslaught''. For example, a {{ui|Blast Cone}} triggered by an ally will cause the {{tip|channel}} to be {{tip|interrupt|interrupted}}.\n** An allied {{cai|Tempered Fate|Bard}} will be resisted however.\n*** If it hits '''Sion''' during the {{fd|0.05}}-second delay before he starts the channel, he will not resist the effect and will initiate the ''slam'' immediately while in {{tip|stasis}}.\n* '''Sion''' is immune to the {{ai|Realm of Death|Mordekaiser}} for 2 seconds after completing the slam after the channel ends.{{bug}}\n* ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' {{tt|cannot strike the same non-champion twice in less than 1 second|Like most AOE spells or spells with traveling hitboxes, it places a marker buff on struck targets. This one lasts 1 second}}.\n* {{Pending for test}} The distance between '''Sion's''' center and the center of the ground ''slam'' scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of ''charge'' time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug.\n* {{Pending for test}} The ''leap'' appears to always have the same speed regardless of '''Sion's''', at roughly 750.\n* Moving the cursor onto HUD elements (e.g [[Map (League of Legends)|mini map]] / champion portraits) does ''not'' jeopardize the cast and steering of ''Unstoppable Onslaught''. The targeting will act as if the ground was targeted below the display element.\n* Even though the [[cooldown]] of ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' starts at the end of the effect, gaining or losing [[ability haste]], or upgrading the ability during the effect, will not change the resuming cooldown.\n* {{tip|Cleanse|Removing}} the {{tip|airborne}} before {{fd|0.5}} seconds will '''not''' prevent the {{tip|stun}} from being applied.\n* {{tip|Displacement immunity}} will also resist the application of the {{tip|stun}}.\n* The following table refers for interactions while '''Sion''' is {{tip|channel|channeling}}:\n{{ct|channel|attack=false|move=Allowed, but cannot input movement commands.|cast= {{ai|Soul Furnace|Sion}} and its {{ai|Soul Furnace 2|Sion|recast}} are usable. {{ai|Decimating Smash|Sion}} and {{ai|Roar of the Slayer|Sion}} are disabled.
