      "notes": "'''Details'''\n* '''Sion's''' death timer starts when he dies and not when ''Glory in Death'' ends.\n** If '''Sion''' lives longer than what his death timer lasts for, he will not revive until ''Glory in Death'' has ended. When it ends, he instantly revives. This may result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.\n* The effect that heals '''Sion''' back to full health at the start of ''Glory in Death'' cannot be modified by {{tip|Grievous Wounds|healing reductions}} and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.\n* ''Glory in Death'' has a capped 60 seconds duration. If the player manages to survive for so long, '''Sion''' dies instantly, regardless of his current health.\n* The healing modifier during ''Glory in Death'' reduces all incoming healing, it does not matter if they are sourced from '''Sion''' himself or an ally. This does not affect life steal.\n** This healing modifier stacks additively with {{ii|Spirit Visage}} and does not stack with heal and shield power.\n** This means that purchasing ''Spirit Visage'' enables '''Sion''' to have regeneration and use healing effects at 25% effectiveness, and the life steal gained will be increased to 125% as expected.\n* The '''fixed''' attack speed is achieved by lowering and increasing the maximum and minimum attack speed to {{sti|attack speed|{{as|1.75|attack speed}}}}, respectively.\n** This also means that it's unaffected by other attack speed modifiers for the duration, such as bonus attack speed or {{tip|cripple|cripples}}.\n** However, {{ri|Hail of Blades}}, which allows for the normal attack speed cap ({{sti|attack speed|{{as|2.5|attack speed}}}}) to be surpassed, will also break this limit. This means that while it is active, '''Sion''' may exceed his {{sti|attack speed|{{as|1.75|attack speed}}}} cap, but cannot fall below it.\n*** This does not apply to {{ri|Lethal Tempo}}.\n*** When {{ri|Hail of Blades}} ends, the attack speed cap will revert to {{sti|attack speed|{{as|2.5|attack speed}}}} and not to {{sti|attack speed|{{as|1.75|attack speed}}}}, however '''Sion''' still can't fall below {{sti|attack speed|{{as|1.75|attack speed}}}}.\n* Some [[item]] passives do not persist through death and will be lost for the initial few seconds of ''Glory in Death''.\n* The bonus on-hit damage granted by ''Glory in Death'' is unaffected by life steal, but is applied against structrures that are not turrets.<!--hmm this may be outdated, I should check this later-->\n** However, it can be applied against structures that are not turrets.{{bug}}\n* The reduction of damage against structures includes '''Sion's''' attacks as well as on-hit effects that can be applied to structures, such as {{ri|Demolish}}, {{ii|Titanic Hydra}} and the magic damage based on {{as|AP}} conversion based on {{tip|adaptive force}}.\n** It even includes {{tip|true damage}} from sources such as {{ii|Elixir of Sorcery}}.{{bug|2}}\n* '''Sion''', during ''Glory in Death'', will not lose health while being carried by {{ai|Fate's Call|Kalista}}.\n* ''Glory in Death'' does not trigger on [[Decoy|clones]] of '''Sion''', such as with {{ai|Test of Spirit|Illaoi}}.\n* ''Glory in Death's'' {{tip|untargetability}} from the {{tip|stasis (buff)|stasis}} does not {{tip|homing projectile destruction|destroy}} in-flight {{tip|projectiles}}.\n** Projectiles created while '''Sion''' is in the zombie form will still travel to him even after he dies.\n* Upon death, the current cooldowns of '''Sion's''' summoner spells are increased to 4 seconds. Afterwards, he is still unable to use them until he respawns.\n** However, it is possible for another lock-out effect to unlock them when their duration ends (excluding {{tip|crowd control}} with the exception of {{tip|stasis}}).\n* After ''Glory in Death'' ends, the corpse of '''Sion''' will retain [[unit collision]] despite being dead on the ground.\n* Buffs from jungle monsters that '''Sion''' acquired during ''Glory in Death'' will not be lost when the duration ends. ({{bi|Crest of Cinders}}, {{bi|Crest of Insight}})\n'''Interactions & Other'''\n* By surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, '''Sion''' will have suffered {{as|{{pp|key=k|36.3654 to 345.4713|round=1}}|health}} in health costs.\n* '''Sion''' can also heal from {{stil|spell vamp}}, althought the stat is currently unobtainable and it would be also unusable during ''Glory in Death'', since there would be no available abilities that would apply it.\n* Even though its visuals are present, {{ri|Dark Harvest}} can never be gained from '''Sion''' under the effect of ''Glory in Death''.\n* At the start of ''Glory in Death'', '''Sion's''' {{tip|mana}} drops to 0, but his {{sti|mana regeneration|{{as|mana regeneration}}}} will remain in effect.\n;Zombie info\n{{Zombie_state_info}}",

Its direction will not change with '''Sion's''' travel, however the location will update with him.\n** The location of the indicator updates at the ''beginning'' of the ability, at ''1 second'' and at ''release''.\n* The indicator of the ability is slightly shorter at its front than the hitbox of the ability is for {{csl|Sion}}, {{csl|Sion|Mecha Zero}} and related skins and chromas, while on {{csl|Sion|Worldbreaker}}, the indicator is slightly thinner at the front than the hitbox is, instead.\n* The following table refers for interactions while '''Sion''' is {{tip|channel|channeling}}:\n{{ct|charge|attack=false|move=false|cast={{ai|Soul Furnace|Sion}} and its {{ai|Soul Furnace 2|Sion|recast}} are usable. {{ai|Roar of the Slayer|Sion}} and {{ai|Unstoppable Onslaught|Sion}} are disabled.

Effects that would increase or decrease his movement speed do not affect him as well.\n** {{cai|I|Nami}} is the only known effect that can affect '''Sion's''' {{as|movement speed}} during the ''charge'' and that can place him above the normal MS value. However, without further multipliers, surpassing the {{as|950 movement speed}} cap will require {{ci|Nami}} to have over {{as|2150 ability power}}.\n* '''Sion''' does not always crash with terrain immediately upon touching it, enabling the player to turn beyond his maximum turning angle.\n** Casting the ability at point blank of a terrain will most often automatically change the ''charge's'' direction.\n** This is not usually possible with player-generated terrain.\n* ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' cannot ''charge'' through but can ''leap'' over [[Terrain#Player-Generated|player-generated terrain]].\n* '''Sion''' loses the {{tip|cc-immune|crowd control immunity}} after finishing the {{tip|lunge|leap}}.\n* '''Sion''' is not immune to {{tip|crowd control}} applied by his allies during ''Unstoppable Onslaught''. For example, a {{ui|Blast Cone}} triggered by an ally will cause the {{tip|channel}} to be {{tip|interrupt|interrupted}}.\n** An allied {{cai|Tempered Fate|Bard}} will be resisted however.\n*** If it hits '''Sion''' during the {{fd|0.05}}-second delay before he starts the channel, he will not resist the effect and will initiate the ''slam'' immediately while in {{tip|stasis}}.\n* '''Sion''' is immune to the {{ai|Realm of Death|Mordekaiser}} for 2 seconds after completing the slam after the channel ends.{{bug}}\n* ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' {{tt|cannot strike the same non-champion twice in less than 1 second|Like most AOE spells or spells with traveling hitboxes, it places a marker buff on struck targets.

In this case, he will stand in place until the root's debuff duration ends. During this time, the damage, stun duration and movement speed granted by the ability will still ramp up, and enemies that come into contact with him will be affected by the collision normally.{{bug}}\n** A similar case allows him to cast it during crowd control that would disable it. However, the channel would be interrupted almost immediately, and he will initiate the leap as well.\n* {{ai|Fate's Call|Kalista}} deferment of ''Unstoppable Onslaught'' will still allow '''Sion''' to leap forward at the end of the channel.\n* Moving the cursor onto HUD elements (e.g [[Map (League of Legends)|mini map]] / champion portraits) does ''not'' jeopardize the cast and steering of ''Unstoppable Onslaught''. The targeting will act as if the ground was targeted below the display element.\n* {{Pending for test}} The distance between '''Sion's''' center and the center of the ground ''slam'' scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of ''charge'' time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug.\n* {{Pending for test}} The ''leap'' appears to always have the same speed regardless of '''Sion's''', at roughly 750.\n* The following table refers for interactions while '''Sion''' is {{tip|channel|channeling}}:\n{{ct|channel|attack=false|move=Allowed, but cannot input movement commands.|cast= {{ai|Soul Furnace|Sion}} and its {{ai|Soul Furnace 2|Sion|recast}} are usable. {{ai|Decimating Smash|Sion}} and {{ai|Roar of the Slayer|Sion}} are disabled. This ability recasts to end channel.|items=false|consume=false|spells=false|interrupts=death}}\n* If ''Unstoppable Onslaught's'' channel is interrupted despite the immunity to crowd control or {{ai|Decimating Smash|Sion}} is cast within {{fd|0.25}} seconds after starting the charge, it will also initiate the leap. If the channel ends due to collision or death, there is no {{tip|lunge|leap}} and the effect occurs immediately.",
