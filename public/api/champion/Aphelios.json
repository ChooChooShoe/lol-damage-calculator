The lunar beam, however, may always be intercepted regardless of which weapon is in play as the main weapon.\n* {{tip|Spell shield}} blocks the ''Moonlight Vigil's'' initial detonation damage but does not prevent the attacks from locking-on.\n* The basic attacks from ''Moonlight Vigil'' {{tip|critically strike}} independently from each other. Targets further away from the center of the blast are hit after a slightly longer delay. These attacks do not apply [[on-attack effects]].\n*Changing weapons while ''Moonlight Vigil'' is in flight does not change the effect it has when it hits.\n* ''Moonlight Vigil'' is always cast from the original casting position.\n* With {{ai|Calibrum|Aphelios}}, the extra damage from consuming the mark is a bonus damage on top of ''Calibrum's '' normal mark consumption damage.\n* With {{ai|Infernum|Aphelios}}, 14 fire bolts splash from each target hit (18 for {{tip|critical strike|critical strikes}}). This does not occur if the initial damage of ''Moonlight Vigil'' [[kill]]s the target.\n* With {{ai|Crescendum|Aphelios}}, 1 spectral chakram is gained for every target hit by the blast, meaning it is possible to gain up to 8 spectral chakrams with one use of ''Moonlight Vigil'' if it hits 5 enemy champions.\n* With {{ai|Severum|Aphelios}}, the extra flat heal is given only once, not per target. However, all damage done by ''Moonlight Vigil'' with it also heals him from ''Severum's '' own passive effect.\n* {{Pending for test}}: Locked-on attacks' interaction with ''parrying'' effects ({{tip|dodge}}, {{tip|block}}, {{tip|blind}}).\n* ''Moonlight Vigil'' has different visual effects changed accordingly to each weapon.
