      "notes": "* The ability will cancel and go on cooldown after the cast time if:\n** The target is {{tip|unstoppable}}, cc-immune or {{tip|spell shield|spell shielded}}.\n** He targets a [[decoy]] or {{cai|Glory in Death|Sion}}.\n* The ability will cancel but will not go on cooldown if:\n** He loses {{tip|sight}} of his target.\n** The target is too far away.\n** The target becomes {{tip|untargetable}}.\n** The target [[death|dies]].\n* If the target's health is lower than the amount that should be stolen, they will be brought down to 1 health. '''Mordekaiser''' will still get the usual amount of maximum health.\n* The boundaries are not considered terrain ({{ai|Unstoppable Onslaught|Sion|exception}}), but enemies that try to move out of the area will be displaced back inside. \n** Abilities such as {{ai|Comet of Legend|Aurelion Sol}} and {{ai|Keeper's Verdict|Poppy}} will cap their effect range to the boundary. Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.\n* Multiple ''Death Realms'' spawned will exist in the same dimension, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\n** {{cai|Devour|Tahm Kench}} can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once {{ai|Regurgitate|Tahm Kench|Regurgitated}}. \n** An active {{ai|Assault and Battery|Vi}} on a target outside the perimeter will cause {{ci|Vi}} to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knockback and damage secondary targets multiple times.\n* The transition in and out of the Death Realm doesn't interrupt [[channel]]s and doesn't affect the target's commands. Being in Death Realm can be dispelled if:\n** The target uses {{ii|Quicksilver Sash}} or abilities with cc-removals.\n** '''Mordekaiser''' or the target cast another ''Realm of Death''. The affected champions will remain stuck for the duration of the new circle.\n* [[Tether]] effects will break upon entering the dimension, unless it is between the two champions entering the dimension.\n* [[Structures]] exist in all realms at the same time, and {{tip|turrets}} will target normally as if all units were in the same realm.\n* Effects interactions:\n** {{ai|The Hextech Ultimatum|Camille}}, catching a {{ai|Spinning Axe|Draven}}, {{ai|Timewinder|Ekko}}, {{ai|Null Zone|Malzahar}}, {{ai|Twisted Advance|Maokai}}, {{ai|Threaded Volley 2|Taliyah|Worked Grounds}}, {{ai|Gravity Field|Viktor}}, {{ai|Satchel Charge|Ziggs}}, {{ui|Rift Scuttler|Rift Scuttler's}} {{bi|Speed Shrine}}, {{ii|Statikk Shiv}} and gaining {{ii|Zeke's Convergence}} [[File:Harbinger of Frost icon.png|20px|border|link=File:Harbinger of Frost icon.png]] area of effect are exceptions and may still take effect between dimensions.\n** Effects such as {{ai|Requiem|Karthus}}, {{ai|Absolute Zero|Nunu}}, {{ai|Grand Starfall|Pantheon}} and {{ai|Final Spark|Lux}} will only deal damage to enemies of the dimension they're in at time of cast. Ending the channel or cast time while inside another dimension will not do damage to nearby enemies.\n** {{ai|Shuriken Flip|Akali}} may be re-cast inside the ''Death Realm'' even if its target is outside it, but {{ci|Akali}} will stop ''dashing'' upon colliding with the boundary.\n** {{ai|Fear Beyond Death 2|Urgot|Fear Beyond Death}} may not be re-cast while his victim is not in the same realm as him, but an already chained foe will still continue to be reeled in and executed. The {{tip|fear}} is cast in the realm Urgot is in.\n** {{ai|Void Shift|Malzahar}} dispels from ''Realm of Death's'' slow, making it vulnerable to the ''Death Realm''.\n** {{ai|Clockwork Windup|Orianna|Ball}} will instantly return back to her if she's in another dimension.\n** Controllable [[pets]] and [[decoy]]s are still controllable between realms.\n* {{pending for test}}:\n** {{ci|Tahm Kench}} {{ai|Devour|Tahm Kench|Devours}} the target affected by ''Death Realm'' before it ends.\n* The {{tip|nearsight}} from {{cai|Paranoia|Nocturne}} does not affect a target’s {{tip|sight|sight radius}} while in the ''Death Realm''.\n** Unless '''Mordekaiser''' and {{ci|Nocturne}} are in the same ''dimension''.",
