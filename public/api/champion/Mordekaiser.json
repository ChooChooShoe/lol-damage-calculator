'''Mordekaiser''' will still get the usual amount of maximum health.\n* Unlike the other stats, '''Mordekaiser''' does not ''steal'' enemy total size; instead he gains 10% of his own size and reduces the enemy's size by 10% of theirs (all size modifiers stack additively).\n** '''Mordekaiser''' grows in size over {{fd|0.25}} seconds after successfully stealing his targets' stats, and shrinks over {{fd|0.25}} seconds after the buff runs out again. The target shrinks over {{fd|0.25}} seconds after their stats are stolen, but grows back to normal size instantly when the effect ends.\n* Entering or leaving the ''Death Realm'' will cause all targeted {{tip|projectile|projectiles}} to be {{tip|homing projectile destruction|destroyed}}.\n* The transition in and out of the ''Death Realm'' doesn't interrupt {{tip|channel|channels}}.\n* The boundaries are not considered terrain ({{ai|Unstoppable Onslaught|Sion}} exception), and enemies that try to move out of the area will be displaced back inside.\n** {{tip|Dash|Dashes}}, {{tip|blink|blinks}}, {{tip|airborne|displacements}} and other forms of movement will cap their effect range to the boundary. Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.\n* Multiple ''Death Realms'' (possible through a {{ai|Hijack|Sylas|hijacked}} ''Realm of Death'' or if multiple '''Mordekaisers''' are in the same match) spawned will exist in the same dimension, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\n** {{cai|Devour|Tahm Kench}} can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once {{ai|Regurgitate|Tahm Kench|Regurgitated}}.\n** An active {{ai|Assault and Battery|Vi}} on a target outside the perimeter will cause {{ci|Vi}} to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knock back and damage secondary targets multiple times.\n* ''Realm of Death'' will not be dispelled if either of the two affected champions enter {{tip|resurrection}} after taking lethal damage. It is dispelled if the target enters a {{tip|zombie state}}.\n* ''Realm of Death'' can be dispelled (excluding death and duration) if:\n** The target uses a {{tip|cleanse|cleansing}} effect, with the exceptions of {{si|Cleanse}}, {{ii|Mikael's Crucible}}, and {{cis|Kled}} {{ai|Skaarl the Cowardly Lizard 2|Kled|Dismount}}.\n*** {{cai|Soul Unbound|Yone}} recast is disabled while he is in the ''Realm of Death''.\n** '''Mordekaiser''' or the target cast another ''Realm of Death''. The affected champions will remain stuck for the duration of the new circle.\n* Any active {{tip|tether}} effects (both friendly and hostile ones) existing on either of the two champions entering the realm will be broken (unless the tether is between those two).\n* [[Structures]] exist in all realms at the same time. {{tip|Turret|Turrets}} will target normally as if all units were in the same realm.\n* The allied health, resource, and ultimate indicators (champion portraits located on the screen) will not update between realms as the [[Summoner|players]] have no {{tip|sight|vision}} of them.\n* ''Realm of Death's'' interactions with other elements/abilities:\n** {{tip|Brush|Brushes}} will maintain their presence between realms.\n** Switching realms detaches all {{tip|attached}} champions on either of the two champions entering the realm.\n** {{ai|The Hextech Ultimatum|Camille}}, catching a {{ai|Spinning Axe|Draven}}, {{ai|Timewinder|Ekko}}, {{ai|Parallel Convergence|Ekko}}, {{ai|Null Zone|Malzahar}}, {{ai|Twisted Advance|Maokai}}, {{ai|Pix, Faerie Companion|Lulu|Pix}}, {{ai|Threaded Volley 2|Taliyah|Worked Grounds}}, {{ai|Gravity Field|Viktor}}, {{ai|Satchel Charge|Ziggs}}, {{ui|Rift Scuttler|Rift Scuttler's}} {{bi|Speed Shrine}}, {{ii|Statikk Shiv}} and gaining {{ii|Zeke's Convergence}} [[File:Harbinger of Frost icon.png|20px|border|link=File:Harbinger of Frost icon.png]] area of effect are exceptions and may still take effect between dimensions ''if'' the conditions are valid.\n** Effects such as {{ai|Requiem|Karthus}}, {{ai|Absolute Zero|Nunu}}, {{ai|Grand Starfall|Pantheon}} and {{ai|Final Spark|Lux}} will only deal damage to enemies of the dimension they're in at time of cast. Ending the channel or cast time while inside another dimension will not do damage to nearby enemies.\n** {{cai|Lamb's Respite|Kindred}} is one of many area of effect abilities that will not take presence between realms.\n** {{ai|Shuriken Flip|Akali}} may be re-cast inside the ''Death Realm'' even if its target is outside it, but {{ci|Akali}} will stop ''dashing'' upon colliding with the boundary.\n** {{ai|Clean Cuts|Xayah|Feathers}} cannot be interacted with between realms by {{ci|Xayah}} ({{ai|Bladecaller|Xayah}} will not call feathers in the other realm towards her).\n** Any spawned terrain while in the ''Death Realm'' will remain inside until expired. They will not be destroyed.\n** {{ai|Weaver's Wall|Taliyah}} is interrupted both when {{ci|Taliyah}} enters the ''Realm of Death'' and leaves it.\n** {{ai|Fear Beyond Death 2|Urgot|Fear Beyond Death}} may not be re-cast while his victim is not in the same realm as him, but an already chained foe will still continue to be reeled in and executed. The {{tip|fear}} is cast in the realm Urgot is in.\n** {{ai|Void Shift|Malzahar}} dispels from ''Realm of Death's'' {{tip|slow}}, making it vulnerable to the ''Death Realm''.\n** {{ai|Clockwork Windup|Orianna|Ball}} will instantly return back to Orianna if she's sent to another dimension.\n** {{ii|Eye of the Herald}} and {{si|Teleport}} are disabled while in the ''Realm of Death''.\n** Controllable [[pets]] and [[decoy]]s can still be commanded between realms.\n** [[Jungle plants]] ({{ui|Blast Cone}}, {{ui|Honeyfruit}}, {{ui|Scryer's Bloom}}) will not take presence between realms.\n** {{cai|Paranoia|Nocturne}} only applies {{tip|nearsight}} to enemy champions in the same dimension as him.\n*** The [[Summoner|player's]] screen will still change in color however.\n{{ct|cast}}",
