''Hijack'' will not trigger the effects of other abilities unless absolutely necessary. \n* Shape-shifting ultimates will transform '''Sylas''' into the target's alternate form, replacing his basic abilities and '''base''' stats. Namely: {{ai|Aspect of the Cougar|Nidalee|Cougar Form}}, {{ai|Spider Form|Elise}}, {{ai|Transform Mercury Cannon|Jayce|Cannon Form}} and {{ai|Dragon's Descent|Shyvana|Dragon Form}}.\n** ''Dragon's Descent'' transforms '''Sylas'''' {{tip|mana}}, into ''Shyvana's'' {{tip|fury}}, being able to replenishing it by basic attacking. At the end of the effect, '''Sylas''' gains his previous mana. \n** ''Dragon's Descent'' does not refresh ability cooldowns upon transforming. \n** ''Spider Form'' freezes Sylas' original cooldowns on their current values, causing them to not come off cooldown during Spider Form. {{bug}}\n** Upon transforming back from {{ai|Transform Mercury Cannon|Jayce|Cannon Form}}, Sylas' next basic attack deals {{ai|Transform Mercury Hammer|Jayce|Transform Mercury Hammer}}'s bonus magic damage and uses his critical strike animation. \n** Transforming into ''Cougar Form'' with more than 2 stacks of Unshackled and then casting {{ai|Takedown|Nidalee|Takedown}} will disable Takedown's effect until the buff timer runs out. {{bug}}\n** Permanent transformations last for ~5 minutes or until toggled off. \n** The alternate abilities of transforming champions will cost mana and scale with the ranks as appropriate for the ability (e.g. ranks in R for Nidalee and ranks in Q/W/E for Jayce/Elise).\n** Upon transforming, a {{ai|Petricite Burst|Sylas}} stack will be deducted.\n** {{ai|Petricite Burst|Sylas}} stacks will still be gained from abilities cast in alternate forms, but the stacks are gained independently from the normal ones.\n*** If '''Sylas''' has both normal and transformed stacks, ''Petricite Burst'' will prioritize consuming '''Sylas''' stacks before the transformed ones.\n* Ultimates comply with {{tip|One for All}} rules if an ally is playing the hijacked champion. For example, an allied {{cai|Hemorrhage|Darius}} stacks will increase the damage of the hijacked {{ai|Noxian Guillotine|Darius}}; or an allied {{cai|Dark Sphere|Syndra}} will add extra damage to hijacked {{ai|Unleashed Power|Syndra}} as well as producing 3 spheres that she can use.\n;Ultimate Interactions\n* {{cai|Spirit Rush|Ahri}} - Does not gain {{ais|Essence Theft|Ahri}} takedown effect thus cannot grant additional recasts.\n* {{cai|Comeuppance|Akshan}} - '''Sylas''' can cast {{ai|Abscond|Sylas}}, but doing so ends the channel prematurely. If '''Comeuppance''' is cast after {{ai|Abduct|Sylas}} but before the chains hit a target, '''Sylas''' isn't pulled to the target and the channel continues as usual. \n* {{cai|Curse of the Sad Mummy|Amumu}} - Does not apply {{ai|Cursed Touch|Amumu}}.\n* {{cai|Moonlight Vigil|Aphelios}} - Based on the {{ai|The Hitman and the Seer|Aphelios|main weapon}} at the moment of steal. \n** {{ai|Crescendum|Aphelios}} empowers his basic attacks temporarily.\n** {{ai|Calibrum|Aphelios}} does not apply marks.\n** {{ai|Severum|Aphelios}} grants a shield if healed while at full health.\n* {{cai|Enchanted Crystal Arrow|Ashe}} - Does not apply {{ai|Frost Shot|Ashe}} to secondary targets. \n* {{cai|Pyroclasm|Brand}} - Does not apply stacks of {{ai|Blaze|Brand}}.\n* {{cai|Feast|Cho'Gath}} - Gains permanent ''Feast'' stacks on-kill.\n* {{cai|Missile Barrage|Corki}} - Gains max charges. \n* {{cai|Noxian Guillotine|Darius}} - Does not apply a stack of {{ai|Hemorrhage|Darius}}.
