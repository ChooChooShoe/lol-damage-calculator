The target will still be ''untargetable'', prevented from taking damage from other sources, and ''suppressed'' during this time.\n** If '''Urgot''' is {{tip|channel|channeling}} a spell, the channel is interrupted when the chains hit.\n* The initial cast always counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as {{nie|Spellblade}}, charging {{ii|Spellbinder}}, and stacking {{ai|Force Pulse|Kassadin}}.\n** If the ability hits a target who is below the threshold, it will automatically recast itself and it won't be considered as an ability activation.\n** If the ability hits a target who is above the threshold and it's recasted early, the recast will happen automatically when they reach the threshold and it won't be considered as as ability activation.\n** If the target got hit while above the threshold and it is recasted after they fall below it, the recast will be considered as an ability activation.\n* Reactivating the ability early will reel the target as soon as they reach the {{as|25% '''maximum''' health}} threshold.\n** The ability will reactivate and execute regardless of '''Urgot''' being affected by {{tip|crowd control}} or not, including self or enemy-imposed {{tip|stasis}}.\n* There is a brief delay before the forced movement and untargetability begins.\n* '''Urgot''' cannot send out the chains if the target is {{tip|untargetable}}.\n* The recast cannot be used (both manually and automatically) while '''Urgot''' is in {{tip|resurrection}}, attempting to manually do so puts it on a 5-second {{sti|cooldown}}.\n** If the target is below the threshold at the end of the duration and '''Urgot''' is revived, the recast will initiate regardless of the cooldown.\n* The recast's chains are classified as a {{tip|projectile}} and they will fail to affect their target if:\n** '''Urgot''' or his target {{tip|death|dies}} (including if '''Urgot''' enters {{tip|resurrection}}).\n** The target becomes {{tip|untargetable}}, even if the granted source does not {{tip|homing projectile destruction|destroy}} in-flight projectiles.\n** They collide with {{ai|Wind Wall|Yasuo}} or {{ai|Unbreakable|Braum}}.\n*** If the target is {{ci|Braum}} and his {{ai|Unbreakable|Braum}} is active, the chains will '''only''' apply the forced movement to him. He will not be executed.\n*** {{ci|Braum}} will be pushed by the chains if he is not the target.\n** The target is {{tip|cc-immune|crowd control immune}} when the chains hit.\n* {{tip|spell shield|Spell shield}} will '''not''' block the recast's chains.\n* Removing the {{tip|suppression}} (e.g. by {{tip|cleanse|cleanses}} or '''Urgot's''' death) during the reel-in will prevent the {{tip|execute}} and stop the forced movement from being renewed, but the most recent one will still be present and move the victim to '''Urgot's''' previous location. The granted ''untargetability'' and prevention of damage to other sources is also lost in the process.\n* {{tip|Displacement immunity}}, while preventing being dragged, does not remove the {{tip|suppression}}, which can last for longer than the usual execution time. Once the target inevitably loses their ''displacement immunity'', they are executed within {{fd|1.5}} seconds. The target is ''untargetable'' and prevented from taking damage from other sources for the whole duration of the ''suppression'', even while ''displacement immune''.\n* When the chains start reeling in and suppressing a [[Summoner|player's]] champion, chains will also cover the sides of their screen.\n* The target champion shrinks in [[size]] in several steps after reaching '''Urgot's''' grinder and before being executed.\n** If the ''suppression'' ends in any way, the target returns to their normal size.\n** If the execution is successful, the victim's corpse will be effectively invisible unless they enter a {{tip|zombie state}}.\n* The target will die regardless of their {{as|'''current''' health}} once the recast's chains hit, even if they are {{tip|heal|healed}}.\n** If the target has {{tip|invulnerability}} that persists the duration of the channel, it will protect them from the execution.\n*** {{ai|Undying Rage|Tryndamere}} will prevent {{ci|Tryndamere}} from dying by the execute. The execute will bypass his minimum health threshold though and reduce him to {{as|1 health}} in this case.\n*** The effect will also not prevent the activation of {{tip|resurrection}} effects, such as {{ii|Guardian Angel}} or {{cai|Rebirth|Anivia}}.\n*** [[Death#Post-death_events|Post-death events]] such as {{tip|zombie state|Zombie State}} effects (e.g, {{cai|Death Defied|Karthus}}, {{cai|Icathian Surprise|Kog'Maw}}, and {{cai|Glory in Death|Sion}}) will be triggered.\n*** Only the target's {{as|'''current''' health}} will count as '''Urgot's''' damage in post-game statistics and {{sti|spell vamp|link=true}} healing.\n* ''Fear Beyond Death's'' initial cast will not perform the automatic recast from dealing enough damage to kill {{ci|Sion}}.\n* The following table refers for interactions while '''Urgot''' is {{tip|channel|channeling}}:\n{{ct|channel|attack=false|cast=false|move=true|items=false, true|spells=true, true, false|interrupts=death}}",
