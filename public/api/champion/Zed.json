They will not prevent '''Zed''' from initiating the cast nor block the detonation from a {{as|mark|buzzword}} that is already applied.\n* If '''Zed''' dies during ''Death Mark'', the ability will cancel instantly and he will reappear at his current location. The cooldown is not compensated.\n** If he enters {{tip|resurrection}} before the dash, ''Death Mark'' does not cancel. If he enters it while dashing, the dash is interrupted.\n* If the {{tip|dash}} is interrupted, '''Zed''' stops, places himself to the ground (ends all displacements affecting him, but does not remove {{tip|airborne}} effects), and reappears prematurely at his current location. The {{as|mark|buzzword}} will still be applied regardless.\n** '''Zed''' will remove {{tip|airborne}} effects from himself immediately upon starting the dash.\n* Once '''Zed''' begins the {{tip|dash}}, two [[File:Zed's Shadow.png|20px|border]] ''Shadows'' will also appear to be dashing through his target, each one spawning a certain distance behind the target (from the right and left). These ''shadows'' do '''not''' mimic abilities and disappear immediately after they stop dashing but they grant {{tip|sight}} of their surroundings.\n** These ''shadows'' have a tracking distance of 2200 and a dash speed of 1750.\n* ''Death Mark'' does not cancel if the target enters a {{tip|zombie state}} before the dash begins.\n* If the {{as|mark's|buzzword}} {{tt|post-mitigation damage|Damage calculated after modifiers}} is higher than the target's '''current''' health, a ''spinning shuriken'' will appear above the victim. This does not necessarily mean the target will die, as it does not consider {{tip|shield|shields}} or forms of [[damage modifier]]s that are not respected by this predictive calculation.\n{{clr}}\n[[File:Spinning_Shuriken_Indicator.png|thumb|center|225px|The indicator shown in-game ''(base skin)''.]]\n{{clr}}\n* This following table refers for interactions while '''Zed''' is in ''Death Mark'':\n{{ct|attack=false|cast=false|move=false|items=false|consume=false|spells=true, false, false, false, false, false, false|interrupts=revival-false}}",
